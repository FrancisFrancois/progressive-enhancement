    <h3>The story</h3>
    
    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
         <p>They said,</p> 
         <blockquote>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote>
         <p>The farmer said,</p>
         <blockquote>“Maybe.”</blockquote>
         <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p> 
         <blockquote>"Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</blockquote>
         <p>The farmer again said,</p> 
         <blockquote>“Maybe.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</p>
         <p>The neighbors then said,</p> 
         <blockquote>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</blockquote>
         <p>and the farmer responded,</p> 
         <blockquote>“Maybe.”</blockquote>
         <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p> 
         <blockquote>“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote>
         <p>Again, he said,</p> 
         <blockquote>“Maybe.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p><span class="Good">Good</span> and <span class="Bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
